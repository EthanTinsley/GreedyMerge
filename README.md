# GreedyMerge
Greedy Merge Algorithm attempts parse text fragments and match fragements with similar substring. Once the sub-strings have been identified the algorithm
merges the two fragments in order to make a superstring. By the end of the algorithm the text fragments should make-up one cohesive superstring.
